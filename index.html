	<div id="explanation">
    <p>This simulates the old Stanford course selection method over our new
    proposed method. The parameters below allow you to tweak the range over
    which the random attributes for each student and course are sampled. Note
    that the variables are sampled from a normal distribution based on the given
    parameters.</p>
		<p>The output metrics are explained as follows:</p>
		<ul>
      <li>Success Rate: Attempted enrollments in non-full classes.</li>
        <li>Full Rate: Attempted enrollments in full classes.</li>
      <li>Drop Rate: Percent of slots in enrolled classes that a student chose
        to drop.</li>
      <li>Pareto Inefficiency: Percentage of classes that a student could have
        gotten into that was dropped by someone else had the other student not
        enrolled in the first place.</li>
		</ul>
    <p>The old mechanism proceeds in the following fashion:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students determine a preference list at random.</li>
      <li>Students are ordered arbitrarily.</li>
      <li>The list of students is enumerated over based on their assigned
        ordering. For each student, that student enrolls in the classes they
        desire until they reach their unit cap. If a student encounters a class
      that is full, they skip it and try the next.</li>
      <li>Each student drops a random class with 50% probability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The new mechanism proceeds in the following fashion:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students determine a preference list at random.</li>
      <li>Students are ordered arbitrarily.</li>
      <li>The list of students is enumerated over based on their assigned
        ordering. For each student, that student enrolls in their most preferred
      class that has space. If the student reaches their desired unit count or
      runs out of courses in their preference list, they are removed from the
      list.</li>
      <li>The previous step occurs until all students are removed from the list.</li>
      <li>Each student drops a random class with 50% probability.</li>
    </ul>
		<p>For the generate graphs, each column represents the number of filled
    classes encountered before successfully enrolling per student over all
    enrollment attempts. Notice the above statistics are similar in the default
    case, however the distributions in the graphs below differ. The distrbution
    for the new system tends to be more centralized meaning the number of
    students that encounter a lot trouble enrolling is lowered at the expense of
    those who don't encounter any trouble, showing that the new system is more equitable.</p>
